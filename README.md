## Releasing

Follow this guide: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-production

### Releasing for Android

- Fetch the keystore from Vaultwarden. Place the file in `android/app/`.
- Edit `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` to add the keystore password:
  ```ini
  SWIPER_CLEANER_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=swiper-cleaner-upload-key.keystore
  SWIPER_CLEANER_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=swiper-cleaner-key
  SWIPER_CLEANER_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=******
  SWIPER_CLEANER_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=******
  ```

```bash
rm ./android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
cd android
./gradlew app:bundleRelease
cd -
open ./android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/
```

This will have created `app-release.aab` in `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/` directory.
